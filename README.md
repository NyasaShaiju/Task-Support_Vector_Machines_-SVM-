# Task-Support_Vector_Machines_-SVM-
This task demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset. Both linear and non-linear (RBF kernel) SVM models were trained and evaluated. The dataset was scaled and reduced to 2D using PCA to visualize decision boundaries. Hyperparameters such as C and gamma were optimized using GridSearchCV, and the model's performance was assessed with cross-validation and classification metrics.

Tools Used: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
Key Concepts: Linear vs. Non-linear SVM, Decision Boundary Visualization, Hyperparameter Tuning, Cross-Validation
